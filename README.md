## Techonologies

- This is a SSR webapp build by NextJS
- Language: Typescript
- Database: Mongo DB

## Deployment

- The whole project will be packaged in a Docker image. It needs to connect to an external MongoDB.
- This web app is designed to be served in two ways:

  1. Standalone web app; it can be hosted for public or internal use.
  2. Embedded in the playground.digital.auto platform as a built-in learning tool.

### Considerations 
- Package and deploy by npm, npx

# For developer

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
