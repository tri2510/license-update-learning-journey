## Never Finished

In the **old way of working**, developing a new vehicle model was treated as a **project with a clear endpoint**: the **Start of Production (SOP)**. After SOP, the development team moved on, and only a few years later, a **new project** might be initiated to create a vehicle **facelift** or **next-generation model**. This approach left little room for continuous improvement after the vehicle’s initial release.

![](https://www.sdv.guide/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F392531723-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252FRqBHYU6DD895ydQm5PcS%252Fuploads%252FqiG0reKs3hSbPArcuHKx%252Fimage.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3Dad8f9228-dd5b-47fd-8954-b6fee29ec3fc&width=768&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=4851ffef&sv=2)

In the modern **software-defined vehicle (SDV)** paradigm, the concept of **"never finished"** is visualized as a continuous improvement process following the **Start of Production (SOP)** milestone. Unlike traditional automotive development models that ended with SOP, SDVs embrace iterative enhancements:

#### Customer Benefits:

-   **Regular Improvements**: Regular updates ensure a constantly improving user experience.
-   **New Features on Demand**: Customers can activate new functionalities as needed.
-   **Personalization**: Tailored settings and user experiences.
-   **Value Retention**: Updates ensure the vehicle remains relevant and competitive over time.

#### Manufacturer Benefits:

-   **New Business Models**: Opportunities for subscriptions, feature unlocks, and service-based revenue streams.
-   **Build/Measure/Learn Cycle**: Continuous feedback loop to optimize features and performance.
-   **Agile Organization**: Adoption of new processes and ways of working.
-   **Ecosystem Expansion**: Vehicles are part of a broader digital and connected ecosystem.

This approach represents a shift from static product development to a **dynamic lifecycle model**, benefiting both customers and manufacturers.

# MHP: Expert Opinion

The SDV transformation demands not only technological evolution but also organizational agility and strategic foresight. **Augustin Friedel** (Senior Manager at MHP - A Porsche Company) provided the input in this chapter to help OEMs navigate the challenges and unlock the potential of this game-changing paradigm.

## Software-defined Vehicle

The Software-Defined Vehicle (SDV) is considered a game changer in the automotive industry. It aims to meet growing customer expectations for features and functions. The term "Software-Defined Vehicle" (SDV) itself is coined by the automotive industry and is not typically relevant for customer marketing.

![](https://www.sdv.guide/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F392531723-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252FRqBHYU6DD895ydQm5PcS%252Fuploads%252Fd0UAUfRdNjVCbvR7C63R%252Fimage.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3D61f6a176-1a81-4214-abd4-482a2f895995&width=768&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=927ee6d4&sv=2)

The core principle of SDVs involves shifting from hardware-embedded software to a setup where software is fully decoupled from the hardware. This creates an abstraction layer for control and management. Much like smartphones, PCs, or tablets, SDVs feature a base hardware layer over which an operating system (OS) runs, enabling flexibility in software and feature management. Operating systems, such as iOS, Android, Linux, or other proprietary platforms, provide the foundation for this innovation in vehicles.

To move forward, SDVs are conceptualized in layers. The **base layer** consists of vehicle hardware (e.g., sensors, high-performance computers, actuators, batteries, and wiring), along with core vehicle software such as the operating system. Above this, the **customer-centric layers** include UX/UI components linked to intelligent cockpits, in-car software, contextual intelligence, and artificial intelligence.

A critical enabler for SDVs is **cloud integration**, which connects vehicles with external devices like smartphones and enables digital twins. This integration ensures the smooth delivery of features for the cockpit, management of vehicle ecosystems, and enhanced interconnectivity with external environments.

## Shift in the E/E-Architecture

The evolution toward SDVs is closely tied to a shift in Electrical/Electronic (E/E) architecture. Historically, vehicles utilized distributed architectures with more than 150 ECUs spread across various vehicle zones. Modern designs, however, aim to consolidate compute power into **zonal or centralized architectures**.

![](https://www.sdv.guide/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F392531723-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252FRqBHYU6DD895ydQm5PcS%252Fuploads%252Fagqm84k2HTciMdvO5web%252Fimage.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3D450fd32e-295e-4e7f-9847-79585e683ee9&width=768&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=6b6a477d&sv=2)

Zonal architectures reduce the number of ECUs by grouping them into zones, allowing for streamlined communication and compute processes. This shift enhances cost efficiency, simplifies integration, and supports a higher degree of standardization. While centralized architectures are the end goal for many OEMs, transitional models, such as modern domain architectures, serve as intermediate steps. The choice between these approaches depends on the strategic priorities, budgets, and skills of individual OEMs.

Governance plays a critical role in managing this transformation. OEMs must structure their organizations effectively to address the challenges of transitioning to modern E/E architectures and ensure their development roadmaps align with market demands.

## E/E + SDV

Combining E/E architectures with SDV principles facilitates a unified approach to vehicle design. **Standardized APIs** are a crucial enabler for this integration, bridging the gap between hardware and software. These APIs simplify the integration process, reduce costs, and create a modular system that can adapt to customer requirements over time.

![](https://www.sdv.guide/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F392531723-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252FRqBHYU6DD895ydQm5PcS%252Fuploads%252FRIkNBnGSjThJuxYaq4Y2%252Fimage.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3D5328d24a-8f79-4479-a3ba-d920f17df502&width=768&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=9b992865&sv=2)

By decoupling the base hardware layer from user-centric features and functionalities, manufacturers can achieve greater flexibility. For instance, features like digital cockpits and AI-driven personalization can be updated independently of hardware upgrades, enabling vehicles to remain competitive throughout their lifecycle.

## Different Change Pace for Each OEM

The automotive industry is witnessing varied progress among OEMs in adopting SDV principles. Based on the **Gartner Digital Automaker Index 2024**, OEMs are categorized into three tiers:

1.  **Leaders**: Companies, particularly in China, are at the forefront of immersive SDV technologies, leveraging AI and cloud integration.
2.  **Middle Field**: Primarily OEMs from Japan, Korea, and parts of Europe, which are transitioning from smart car features to full SDV integration.
3.  **Challengers**: OEMs that are still focusing on basic smart car capabilities, such as OTA updates and first-generation app stores.

China, with brands like Huawei, Xiaomi, and JiYue, has surpassed Tesla in several areas of SDV development, particularly in immersive digital living spaces. This regional advantage stems from a focus on AI-driven features, intelligent cockpits, and rapid software development cycles.

![](https://www.sdv.guide/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F392531723-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252FRqBHYU6DD895ydQm5PcS%252Fuploads%252FFtOxc09JRdeyc4Lc7DKm%252Fimage.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3Dfdb6a627-2a95-4564-b808-3fec8d66aac6&width=768&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=52793db2&sv=2)

## Levels of SDVs

SDVs can be categorized into three progressive tiers:

1.  **Smart Cars**: Vehicles offering basic OTA updates, app stores, and limited customization.
2.  **Software-Defined Vehicles**: These feature smartphone-like OS releases, extensive backward compatibility, and flexible compute power.
3.  **Immersive SDVs**: Fully integrated with AI and contextual intelligence, these vehicles offer seamless cloud connectivity and cutting-edge features. Immersive SDVs are predominantly seen in advanced markets like China, while Europe and the US are still transitioning.

## Two Speed Delivery Model

To manage the complexities of SDV development, OEMs adopt a **two-speed delivery model**: Fast Cycle vs Slower Cycle. This approach allows manufacturers to address both the demand for rapid innovation and the need for robust platform-level development.

![](https://www.sdv.guide/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F392531723-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252FRqBHYU6DD895ydQm5PcS%252Fuploads%252FjgSeR1wpIVwkUKcUpnoW%252Fimage.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3Dc220c767-658b-4e89-8d3a-aef01965a901&width=768&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=7c59575b&sv=2)

### Fast Cycle

The fast cycle focuses on feature development, leveraging **DevOps** and **agile methodologies**. This approach enables quick iterations and faster delivery of new features. Key elements include:

-   CI/CD pipelines for streamlined development and integration.
-   Shift-North strategies to accelerate innovation and feature rollouts.

### Slower Cycle

The slower cycle involves platform-level development using systems engineering models like the **V-model**. A **shift-left** approach ensures early identification and resolution of issues during development, minimizing costly fixes later in the process. This dual-speed framework helps OEMs balance rapid feature delivery with robust platform development.

# Challenges: What sets automotive software development apart?

Automotive software development is uniquely challenging, marked by its focus on functional safety, inherent complexity, and the balance between rigid and flexible development paradigms. These factors set it apart from other industries and make it one of the most demanding fields in software engineering today.

![](https://www.sdv.guide/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F392531723-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252FRqBHYU6DD895ydQm5PcS%252Fuploads%252FzI7p7l0Qzzdr6zcLyvtx%252Fimage.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3Dc7db49e7-2ca3-4754-8d22-117bb10c37f4&width=768&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=2682d117&sv=2)

## Key: Functional Safety

Automotive software development stands apart due to its strict focus on **functional safety**. This concept is defined as the **absence of unreasonable risk** caused by hazards resulting from malfunctioning electric or electronic systems. Functional safety is essential to ensure that critical systems, such as airbags or braking systems, function correctly under all circumstances. This requirement places automotive software development in a class of its own, compared to other industries like desktop or consumer applications.

## ISO 26262: ASIL (Automotive Safety Integrity Level)

To meet stringent safety requirements, the automotive industry adheres to the **ISO 26262 standard**, which defines **Automotive Safety Integrity Levels (ASIL)**. These levels classify risks from **ASIL A** (lowest safety requirement) to **ASIL D** (highest safety requirement). A separate level, **QM (Quality Management)**, is applied when there is no significant hazard involved.

#### Examples of ASIL Classifications:

-   **ASIL A**: Failure of rear lights or windshield wipers, which pose minimal safety risks.
-   **ASIL B**: Issues with headlights, which moderately affect visibility.
-   **ASIL C/D**: Problems with engine control, such as unintended acceleration or critical safety system failures.
