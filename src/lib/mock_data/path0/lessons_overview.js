# SDV101

Welcome to **SDV101**, the first part of the **SDV Guide** series. This guide accompanies the **SDV101: Introduction to Software-Defined Vehicles** course on Coursera, providing additional insights, explanations, and examples to support your learning journey. It is the successor to the successful Software-Defined Vehicle ebook by O'Reilly (Dirk Slama, Achim Nonnenmacher, Thomas Irawan).

Whether you are new to the world of Software-Defined Vehicles or looking to strengthen your understanding, this guide will serve as your reference throughout the course and beyond.

Let's begin your journey into the exciting field of Software-Defined Vehicles!



## Roots of this Project

In 2023, Dirk Slama (Bosch/Steinbeis FSTI), Achim Nonnenmacher (ETAS), and Thomas Irawan (ETAS) published the foundational _Software-Defined Vehicle_ üëâ [ebook](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/the-software-defined-vehicle/9781098157814) with O'Reilly. This pioneering work introduced key concepts and provided a solid starting point for understanding the SDV paradigm.

Building on this foundation, the _SDV Guide_ has been re-imagined as a much more comprehensive resource, expanding the original content to five distinct parts. These additions dive deeper into the evolving SDV ecosystem, offering advanced topics, real-world case studies, and the latest industry insights. Far from being a mere extension or copy, the _SDV Guide_ delivers a robust framework for practitioners, researchers, and innovators, shaping the future of automotive software development.
